This project presents incident summaries of UFO sightings that can be filtered by:
    # Shape of the UFO
    # Country of incident
    # State of incident
    # City of incident
    # Date of incident
    or any combination of the above.

## We used javascript code to create a table that could be filtered by any combination of 5 data fields.  HTML and css were used to present the data in a familiar and easy to use format.  This table is adaptive in that were more data imported into the data.js file no extra work would be needed to add new incidents into the searchable table.  

## Out of scope for the present project but a future "nice-to-have" would be a map feature that would be associated with each incident report.  This would enhance analysis by allowing geographic patterns to possibly emerge.
